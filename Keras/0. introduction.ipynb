So this is a challenging machine learning problem, but it is also a realistic one: in a lot of real-world use cases, even small-scale data collection can be extremely expensive or sometimes near-impossible (e.g. in medical imaging). Being able to make the most out of very little data is a key skill of a competent data scientist."

    "How difficult is this problem? When Kaggle started the cats vs. dogs competition (with 25,000 training images in total), a bit over two years ago, it came with the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"In an informal poll conducted many years ago, computer vision experts posited that a classifier with better than 60% accuracy would be difficult without a major advance in the state of the art. For reference, a 60% classifier improves the guessing probability of a 12-image HIP from 1/4096 to 1/459. The current literature suggests machine classifiers can score above 80% accuracy on this task [[ref]](http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/dogcat.pdf).\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the resulting competition, top entrants were able to score over 98% accuracy by using modern deep learning techniques. In our case, because we restrict ourselves to only 8% of the dataset, the problem is much harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On the relevance of deep learning for small-data problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A message that I hear often is that \"deep learning is only relevant when you have a huge amount of data\". While not entirely incorrect, this is somewhat misleading. Certainly, deep learning requires the ability to learn features automatically from the data, which is generally only possible when lots of training data is available --especially for problems where the input samples are very high-dimensional, like images. However, convolutional neural networks --a pillar algorithm of deep learning-- are by design one of the best models available for most \"perceptual\" problems (such as image classification), even with very little data to learn from. Training a convnet from scratch on a small image dataset will still yield reasonable results, without the need for any custom feature engineering. Convnets are just plain good. They are the right tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what's more, deep learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can take, say, an image classification or speech-to-text model trained on a large-scale dataset then reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes, as we will see in this post. Specifically in the case of computer vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet dataset) are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap powerful vision models out of very little data.\n",

Our original images consist in RGB coefficients in the 0-255, but such values would be too high for our models to process (given a typical learning rate), so we target values between 0 and 1 instead by scaling with a 1/255. factor.\n",
    "- *shear_range* is for randomly applying [shearing transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping)\n",
    "- *zoom_range* is for randomly zooming inside pictures\n",
    "- *horizontal_flip* is for randomly flipping half of the images horizontally --relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal assymetry (e.g. real-world pictures).\n",
    "- *fill_mode* is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift.\n",
